# Recoil

Recoil is a general-purpose C++20 header-only rANS library. 
It contains templates for various traditional rANS applications, as well as the algorithm described in the paper of the same name
[Recoil: Parallel rANS Decoding with Decoder-Adaptive Scalability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12141). 

## Dependencies

Since the library utilizes C++20 features heavily, newer compilers and runtime libraries are required.

- gcc 10+ / clang 14+
- CMake 3.24+
- CUDA 12+

Dockerfile and some test scripts are also available in [recoil-testscript](https://github.com/lin-toto/recoil-testscripts).

## Getting Started

Detailed documentations TODO. For now, please check `examples/` for sample library usage.
